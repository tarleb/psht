# PShT

**P**resentations in **Sh**ell and **T**erminal.

It allows to combine

- slides and
- live demos

in the terminal.

## How it works

PShT is a shell *function* and *library* that provides a simple
and standardized way to step through slides. Any program or script
can serve as a slide, as long as it's in the `_slides`
subdirectory.

The `_slides` folder in the source repository can serve as an
example.
